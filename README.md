# Organize Your Music Folder

This is a simple script that will take your music folder and organize it based on music metadata. 

## Warning!

Before executing this script, make sure to back up your existing folder! 

## How to use

1. Copy .env.example to .env and change the source and destination variables to match your environment.
2. Run `npm install`
3. Run `node index.js`

## TODO

- Be able to parse and handle iTunes XML libraries (not the newest Music format)
- This is a quick script, so it could probably use some fine tuning. There's probably some other needed refactoring as well, but this was oriignally created to be a one-off script.
